Is there any reward for good other than good?
No disaster strikes except by permission of Allah .
And whoever believes in Allah â€“ He will guide his heart.
And Allah is Knowing of all things.
If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins.
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And whoever holds firmly to Allah has [indeed] been guided to a straight path. 
Say, He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah , the Eternal Refuge.
